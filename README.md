**1. Introduction**
The Pharmacy Management System project is designed to streamline the operations of a local pharmacy. The system enables pharmacists to manage drug inventory, track sales, view suppliers, and maintain purchase histories efficiently. This project leverages data structures and algorithms to optimize various functionalities.


**Objectives**:
•	To implement a user-friendly system for managing pharmacy operations.
•	To utilize appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient data management.
•	To provide a comprehensive system that supports adding, searching, and viewing drugs and their purchase histories.
Scope of the Project: The project focuses on developing a robust backend using Java and integrating it with a user-friendly frontend. The system will also use MySQL for database management.

**2. System Description**
_Functional Requirements:_
•	Add drugs to the inventory.
•	Search for a drug by name or code.
•	View all drugs and their suppliers.
•	View purchase history for each drug.

_Non-functional Requirements:_
•	Performance: The system should handle multiple transactions efficiently.
•	Usability: The interface should be intuitive for users.


**3. System Design**
_Data Structures Used:_
•	LinkedLists: For maintaining the list of drugs.
•	Stacks: For tracking purchase history.
•	Arrays: For storing fixed-size collections of items.
•	Queues: For managing tasks in a first-in-first-out order.

_Algorithms Implemented:_
•	Searching Algorithms: To find drugs and suppliers quickly.
•	Sorting Algorithms: To arrange drugs and purchase histories in a specific order.

_Database Design:_
•	Tables and Relationships: Tables for drugs, suppliers, purchase history, and sales.


**4. Implementation**
Overview of the Codebase: The project is implemented in Java with a MySQL database backend. The frontend is designed using JFrame for a rich user interface.

_Key Modules and Functions:_
•	Drug Management Module: Handles adding, deleting, and searching for drugs.
•	Supplier Management Module: Manages supplier information and links to drugs.
•	Purchase History Module: Tracks and displays purchase history for each drug.
•	Sales Tracking Module: Records sales transactions and updates inventory.
User Interface Design: The UI is designed to be user-friendly with intuitive navigation. It includes forms for adding and searching drugs, viewing all drugs and suppliers, as well as checking purchase histories.
Integration with Database: The system uses JDBC for database connectivity and operations. Queries are optimized for performance.


**5. Contributions of Group Members**
•	Klutse Isaac: Developed the reporting feature for viewing drug sales. Created the user manual and documentation. Conducted system testing and validation.
•	Agyekum Paul: Managed the project timeline and tasks. Coordinated group meetings and communication. Contributed to code reviews and debugging.
•	Wisdom Emeka: Developed the module for viewing all drugs and their suppliers. Implemented sorting algorithms for purchase history. Managed the database schema design.
•	Richard Owusu Ahwireng: Designed the user interface for the application. Integrated the UI with the backend. Conducted usability testing.
•	Dennis Gross - 10963604: Integrated the application with the MySQL database. Implemented recursive algorithms for searching suppliers. Handled backend optimization.
•	Godfred Ansoh Jnr: Implemented the data structure for drug management using LinkedLists. Developed the search functionality for finding drugs. Documented the code for the drug management module. 
•	Sylvester Kojo Mintah: Created the functionality for adding and deleting drugs. Implemented the stack data structure for tracking purchase history. Conducted performance analysis of algorithms. 


**6. Testing and Evaluation**
_Testing Strategies:_
•	Unit Testing: Tested the individual components.
•	Integration Testing: We ensured that, all the modules work together.
•	System Testing: Tested the entire system for majority of the issues.

_Test Cases:_
•	Adding a new drug.
•	Searching for a drug.
•	Viewing purchase history.
•	Checking supplier details.
Results: All test cases passed successfully, and the system performed as expected.


**8. Performance Analysis**
_Big O Notation Analysis:_
•	Adding a drug: O(1)
•	Searching for a drug: O(n)
•	Viewing purchase history: O(n log n) (due to sorting)

_Omega Notation Analysis:_
•	Adding a drug: Ω(1)
•	Searching for a drug: Ω(1)
•	Viewing purchase history: Ω(n)


**9. Conclusion**
_Summary of Achievements:_
•	Successfully implemented a Pharmacy Management System with comprehensive features.
•	Used appropriate data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient performance.

_Challenges Faced:_
•	Integrating the UI with the backend was the major challenge we faced as a group, but we manage to make it work with a lot of research and reading. 
Future Work:
•	Adding more features like inventory alerts.
•	Enhancing the user interface for better user experience.
•	Improving the backend architecture to enhance the overall system performance and user experience
